# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project

This Capstone Project is part of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate hosted on Coursera. The IBM Data Science program consists of 9 online courses that aims to provide one with the latest job-ready tools and skills, including open source tools and libraries, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms.

**Project Overview**  
The capital of Pakistan, Islamabad, considered as the second most beautiful capital of the world is home to some of the most favorite restaurants across the country. Every year millions of tourists both national and international visit here to enjoy the natural beauty of the city while feasting on the variety of foods it has to offer. But with many restaurants to choose from, it often fills the new tourists with overload of choices, and choosing a bad restaurant can lead to a miserable experience for the tourists. For this project, I decided to take on the challenge of finding the most popular sectors of Islamabad for dining out. With the use of K-Means clustering and other libraries, I found that the Sectors F-6 and F-7 were the most popular sectors for dining out while Sectors F-8 and F-11 came second. The capstone report provides the detailed overview of these findings while the IBM_Capstone_Project.ipynb file contains the coding requirements for this project. 

Exploring & Clustering the Neighborhoods in Toronto was another requirement for completion of this program which is also available in this repository.

**Software and Libraries**  
This project was built using Google Colaboratory and Python 3. The libraries imported includes:  
Numpy  
Pandas  
SKLearn  
Matplotlib  
Seaborn  
Folium  
K-Means / Clustering  
Plotly
